# SimpleSetup

*a simple CLI C# program to setup your computer for anything.*

Anybody, from pros to newbies can work on this code because it is very simple (maybe cos im newbie too)

this is more or less for funsies

NOTE: This is a personal program of mine, which means it is NOT polished, and works for very specific cases. but, if enough traction is gained, this might become a complete desktop application.

better stuff coming soon.
